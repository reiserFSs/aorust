# `aomac play` — the windowed client (M2)

`aomac` with no arguments, or `aomac play`, opens the original login flow (spec + RE evidence: `docs/screens.md`; GUI engine:
`ao-gui`): `LoginWindow` over the `LoginWorld_c` 3D backdrop → `ProgressDialog` → `CharacterSelectionWindow` with the
`CharacterViewer_c` preview → loading screen (`ai_loading_login.png`, 4 s fade-in, 7 s fade-out) → the character's playfield.

## Logging in

1. `cargo run --release -p aomac` (or `aomac play`; `--server Ithaca` picks a server by name — the status API lists them, the
   chosen one is printed on stderr and remembered; default: last used, else the first).
2. Type the username, then the password (focus starts in the password field as in the original; typing a username clears the
   password field, exactly like `SlotUsernameModified`). Login enables once both are non-empty. Enter or Login connects.
3. After a successful login the username (never the password) is remembered in
   `~/Library/Application Support/aomac/prefs.txt` (stand-in for `prefs/Prefs.xml` `LauncherConfig`; combo box + Remove work).
4. Pick a character (click, Up/Down; the 3D preview follows), **Play** or Enter. After `ZoneHandoff` the loading screen fades in,
   the zone connection is made, the playfield is loaded and the loading screen dissolves into it. Esc quits in the world;
   WASD/right-mouse free-fly as in the viewer.

Errors: `ShowError(code, arg)` opens `<ERRORURL><code>[-<arg>].html` (ERRORURL from `AnarchyLauncher.url`) in the default browser
(`open`), the login window stays up (docs/screens.md §3.6). Connect failure → 1; login refused (0x0d) / rejected (0x21) → type + detail;
login connection lost → 3 ([INFERENCE]). Non-login notices (character slots exhausted, playfield load failure, in-world) use a
ProgressDialog-based box with "OK".

Clipboard: Cmd+C/X/V/A in text fields use the OS clipboard (`arboard`); the password field never copies/cuts (`tvf::PASSWORD`).

## App bundle

`scripts/bundle.sh` → `target/aomac.app` (release build; `Contents/MacOS/aomac` execs `aomac-bin play`; Info.plist: high-res capable,
games category, macOS ≥ 12). The client is found from `$HOME/Games/ProjectRubiKa/client` (HOME is set when launched from Finder;
`bundle.sh` honours `AOMAC_CLIENT` only for the icon). The icon is the client's own: `AnarchyOnline.exe` RT_GROUP_ICON (identical to
`Anarchy.exe`'s), extracted by `scripts/exe_icon.py` at bundle time (not committed). The exe carries only a 32×32 4-bpp image, so larger
`.icns` sizes are upscaled. Verified: `open target/aomac.app` shows the login window; Cmd+V/A/C round-trip through the clipboard.

## Deliberate deviations / not implemented (all labelled)

* **Server choice** is outside the original window (the original gets the server from the PRK launcher's `IA`/`IP` arguments):
  `--server` + remembered, no in-window picker.
* New Character opens the original character creation, Delete the name-confirmation window (docs/screens.md §12); live creation is untested. The creation cameras use the full `CharCreateCamera.dat` orientation incl. roll (`ao_render::Camera::roll`); the name-scene error sounds `SM_Sandy_CC_Name` / `SM_Sandy_CC_Nick` exist in no sound bank, so (like the original) they are silent; profession hover/leave/click text rules: docs/screens.md §12.
* Row "Inactive" uses bit 0 of the list's per-row `status` word as RE'd (`docs/screens.md` §5.3); what PRK actually sends in that word is
  unverified (live check pending an account).
* Preview socials are built on demand in the background (idle plays until ready); the original has no delay.
* Preview lighting/FOV convention: UNRESOLVED (renderer default; `docs/screens.md` §11).
* The startup music cue plays at the zone hand-off; the original starts it on `CharacterLoggedInMessage` (0x26) — the zone message
  is not decoded yet (M3 seam: `Play::on_zone_event`).

## Debug flags (hidden)

`--fake-charlist [--select N]` shows a built-in list (offline character-select check; Play then runs only the loading screen).
`AOMAC_PERF=1` prints preview build timings. With `--fake-charlist` an in-process fake server answers New Character (random name "Zalokon", "Taken" → name in use, else created + hand-off to the loading screen) and Delete; `AOMAC_CC_SKIP_INTRO=1` jumps to the breed scene; Esc in creation skips the running camera move (docs/screens.md §12).

## Headless tests

`crates/aomac/src/play/flow/tests.rs` drives the real `Play` state machine (real client GUI XML/skin, no window) through
Login → Cancel / timeout → late `Bg::Connected(Ok/Err)` (stale results are dropped, the session closed, the hidden LoginWindow is
shown again, not recreated), and the `SlotLoginReply` routing: `LoginError` → `ShowError(0x0d, code)`, `Rejected` → `(0x21, detail)`
(signed `%d`, also during character creation), connection lost → `(3,0)`. Error URLs are recorded instead of opened under `cfg(test)`.
`AOMAC_PREFS_DIR` redirects the prefs directory. Both skip without the client.

`AOMAC_SHOT_DIR=<dir> cargo test --release -p aomac shots -- --nocapture` renders login, character select, the delete dialog and every
creation scene (real mouse/keyboard input at window coordinates: breed pick, head/height/build, profession, name, close → exit dialog)
offscreen through `ao_render::Offscreen` (same frame sequence as the windowed app) into PNGs. No window or unlocked session needed.
